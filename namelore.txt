stair14's name lore

Discord: I started with irrelevant names but eventually transitioned to “airs,” because I wanted to match my ex-best friend’s name (wind) without her noticing. Then I added “14” because I thought it was a cool number, and subtracted a number I liked, 10, from my ex-best friend's birthday day (24), additionally adding an s for her initial (s) turning it into "airs14." Later, I switched to "stair14" to incorporate her initial subtly.

Roblox: My first Roblox name was "moo_mod1224," inspired by modding io games like moomoo.io using javascript when I was around 8, and I added my birthday (day and month). Later, I came up with "proscombag" from cheating in Roblox at the time aka terrorizing kids, and being good at it (from “pro scum bag,” but had to swap the "u" to bypass the filter because Roblox didn’t allow cum). Eventually, I went with "juliet" during a phase of matching names with a friend, inspired by Romeo and Juliet, but I did choose to have a lowercase j as I thought it would be cool. Another name I had was "pulsar11" Pulsar came from the space object that spins fast and I thought it was cool. The number "11" came from a crush whose birthday was 11/11. (don't ask)

Other Platforms: Most of my names follow the same pattern as Discord, where I mainly use "stair14" or sometimes “julie.” from Juliet but shortened, and still holds meaning as it is a favorable band of mine.

The number "14" became significant because I thought 14 was a cool age to be and seeing it in pedo-catching videos where the guy says "I'm 14". I also like the number 10, which came from a random childhood thought of doubling 5 after gazing at the night sky, polluted by lights in the tightly packed city of New York.
